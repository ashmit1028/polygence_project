sending request to Gemini: question:"Jar $A$ contains four liters of a solution that is $45\%$ acid. Jar $B$ contains five liters of a solution that is $48\%$ acid. Jar $C$ contains one liter of a solution that is $k\%$ acid. From jar $C$, $\frac{m}{n}$ liters of the solution is added to jar $A$, and the remainder of the solution in jar $C$ is added to jar B. At the end both jar $A$ and jar $B$ contain solutions that are $50\%$ acid. Given that $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $k + m + n$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Set up equations based on the acid content:**

* **Jar A:**  Initially, jar A has 4 liters * 0.45 = 1.8 liters of acid. After adding the solution from jar C, it has 1.8 + (m/n) * (k/100) liters of acid.  Since the final concentration is 50%, we have: 
   (1.8 + (m/n) * (k/100)) / (4 + (m/n)) = 0.5

* **Jar B:** Initially, jar B has 5 liters * 0.48 = 2.4 liters of acid. After adding the remaining solution from jar C, it has 2.4 + ((1 - m/n) * (k/100)) liters of acid. Since the final concentration is 50%, we have:
   (2.4 + ((1 - m/n) * (k/100))) / (5 + (1 - m/n)) = 0.5

**2. Simplify the equations:**

* **Jar A:** 1.8 + (mk/100n) = 2 + (m/2n)
* **Jar B:** 2.4 + (k/100 - mk/100n) = 2.5 + (1/2 - m/2n)

**3. Solve for k:**

* Combine the equations for jar A and jar B to eliminate (m/2n):  
    1.8 + (mk/100n) + 2.4 + (k/100 - mk/100n) = 2 + (m/2n) + 2.5 + (1/2 - m/2n)
    4.2 + (k/100) = 5

* Solve for k:
    k/100 = 0.8
    k = 80

**4. Solve for m and n:**

* Substitute k = 80 back into either of the original equations. Let's use the equation for jar A:
    1.8 + (80m/100n) = 2 + (m/2n)

* Simplify and solve for m/n:
    180 + 8m = 200 + 5m
    3m = 20
    m/n = 20/3

**5. Find k + m + n:**

* Since m and n are relatively prime, m = 20 and n = 3.

* Finally, calculate k + m + n:
    k + m + n = 80 + 20 + 3 = **103** 

Therefore, the answer is **103**.

    1.8 + (80m/100n) = 2 + (m/2n)

* Simplify and solve for m/n:
    180 + 8m = 200 + 5m
    3m = 20
    m/n = 20/3

**5. Find k + m + n:**

* Since m and n are relatively prime, m = 20 and n = 3.

* Finally, calculate k + m + n:
    k + m + n = 80 + 20 + 3 = **103** 

Therefore, the answer is **103**.

 The sum of the acid concentration percentage, the volume of solution transferred from jar C to jar A, and the volume of solution transferred from jar C to jar B is 103.

Points $E$ and $F$ lie inside rectangle $ABCD$ so that $BE = 9$, $DF = 8$, $\overline{BE} \parallel \overline{DF}$, $\overline{EF} \parallel \overline{AB}$, and line $BE$ intersects segment $\overline{AD}$.

Since $\overline{BE} \parallel \overline{DF}$, we have $\angle BED = \angle DFE$. Also, $\angle EBD = \angle FDC$ because they are corresponding angles formed by parallel lines. Therefore, triangles $BED$ and $DFE$ are similar.

Let $x = DE$ and $y = EF$.  Then, by similarity, $\frac{x}{9} = \frac{8}{y}$.  Also, since $BE \parallel DF$, we have $x + y = 10$.

Solving the system of equations, we get $x = \frac{72}{17}$ and $y = \frac{80}{17}$.  Thus, $EF = \boxed{4\sqrt{5} - \frac{8}{17}}$ and $m+n+p = 4+5+8 = \boxed{17}$.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Let $L$ be the line with slope $\frac{5}{12}$ that contains the point $A=(24,-1)$, and let $M$ be the line perpendicular to line $L$ that contains the point $B=(5,6)$. The original coordinate axes are erased, and line $L$ is made the $x$-axis and line $M$ the $y$-axis. In the new coordinate system, point $A$ is on the positive $x$-axis, and point $B$ is on the positive $y$-axis. The point $P$ with coordinates $(-14,27)$ in the original system has coordinates $(\alpha,\beta)$ in the new coordinate system. Find $\alpha+\beta$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the Equation of Line L**

* We know the slope of line L is 5/12 and it passes through point A(24, -1).  We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:
   y - y1 = m(x - x1)
   y - (-1) = (5/12)(x - 24)
   y + 1 = (5/12)x - 10
   y = (5/12)x - 11 

**2. Find the Equation of Line M**

* Line M is perpendicular to line L, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of 5/12, which is -12/5.  It passes through point B(5, 6).  Using the point-slope form again:
   y - 6 = (-12/5)(x - 5)
   y - 6 = (-12/5)x + 12
   y = (-12/5)x + 18

**3. Find the Intersection Point of Lines L and M**

* To find the intersection point, we can set the equations of line L and line M equal to each other:
   (5/12)x - 11 = (-12/5)x + 18
* Solve for x:
   (61/60)x = 29
   x = 1740/61
* Substitute this value of x back into either equation to find y:
   y = (5/12)(1740/61) - 11 = 235/61

**4.  The New Coordinate System**

* The intersection point (1740/61, 235/61) becomes the origin (0, 0) in the new coordinate system.
* Line L is now the x-axis, and line M is now the y-axis.

**5. Find the Coordinates of Point A in the New System**

* Since A lies on the positive x-axis (line L) in the new system, its y-coordinate is 0.  
* To find its x-coordinate, we need to find the distance from the origin (1740/61, 235/61) to point A (24, -1) along line L.  
* We can use the distance formula, but since it's on the same line, we can simply find the change in x:
   24 - (1740/61) = 1224/61 
* So, point A has coordinates (1224/61, 0) in the new system.

**6. Find the Coordinates of Point B in the New System**

* Since B lies on the positive y-axis (line M) in the new system, its x-coordinate is 0.
* To find its y-coordinate, we need to find the distance from the origin (1740/61, 235/61) to point B (5, 6) along line M.
* Again, since it's on the same line, we can simply find the change in y:
   6 - (235/61) = 151/61
* So, point B has coordinates (0, 151/61) in the new system.

**7. Find the Coordinates of Point P in the New System**

* We need to find the distances from point P (-14, 27) to line L and line M.  We can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line:
    Distance from (x1, y1) to line Ax + By + C = 0 is:
    |Ax1 + By1 + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)
* For line L (5x - 12y - 132 = 0), the distance from P is:
    |5(-14) - 12(27) - 132| / sqrt(5^2 + (-12)^2) = 450/13
* For line M (12x + 5y - 108 = 0), the distance from P is:
    |12(-14) + 5(27) - 108| / sqrt(12^2 + 5^2) = 285/13
* Since point P is 450/13 units to the left of line L (the new x-axis) and 285/13 units above line M (the new y-axis), its coordinates in the new system are (-450/13, 285/13).

**8. Calculate α + β**

* α + β = (-450/13) + (285/13) = -165/13

**Therefore, α + β = -165/13**

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have \[\frac{BL}{LC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{125}{117}\]and \[\frac{AK}{KC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{125}{120} = \frac{25}{24}.\]Since $\angle BKC = \angle ALC = 90^\circ,$ quadrilaterals $BCKM$ and $ALCN$ are cyclic. Therefore, \[\angle BMC = \angle BKC = 90^\circ - \angle KBC = 90^\circ - \angle ABK = \angle ANL.\]Also, $\angle BCM = \angle ACN,$ so triangles $BMC$ and $ANL$ are similar. Thus, \[\frac{MN}{BC} = \frac{CM}{CL} = \frac{CK}{CL} - 1 = \frac{AK}{AL} - 1 = \frac{AK}{AB + BL} - 1 = \frac{AK}{AB + \frac{AB}{AC} \cdot BC} - 1.\]Substituting the values we found, we get \[\frac{MN}{120} = \frac{\frac{25}{24}}{125 + \frac{125}{117} \cdot 120} - 1 = \frac{117}{780} - 1 = -\frac{663}{780}.\]Therefore, $MN = \boxed{-\frac{663}{6.5}}.$ Note that the negative sign indicates that $M$ and $N$ are on opposite sides of $C.$

sending request to Gemini: question:"The vertices of a regular nonagon (9-sided polygon) are to be labeled with the digits 1 through 9 in such a way that the sum of the numbers on every three consecutive vertices is a multiple of 3. Two acceptable arrangements are considered to be indistinguishable if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the nonagon in the plane. Find the number of distinguishable acceptable arrangements. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Constraints**

* **Regular Nonagon:** All sides and angles are equal.
* **Multiples of 3:** The sum of any three consecutive vertices must be divisible by 3.

**Key Observation**

Notice that the digits 1, 2, and 3 must be placed in a way that satisfies the multiple of 3 rule.  The only way to achieve this is if they are placed consecutively (either 1-2-3, 2-3-1, or 3-1-2).  The same logic applies to the digits 4, 5, and 6, as well as 7, 8, and 9.

**Building the Arrangement**

1. **Start with a Set:** Choose one of the sets (1-2-3, 4-5-6, or 7-8-9). Let's say we start with 1-2-3.

2. **Placement:**  Place the set of 1-2-3 in a clockwise direction. It doesn't matter where you start on the nonagon since rotations are considered equivalent.

3. **Second Set:**  Now, we need to place the second set (let's say 4-5-6).  There are three possible positions for the 4, which will determine the placement of the entire set:
   * **Between 1 and 3:**  This creates a repeating pattern of 1-2-3-4-5-6-...
   * **Between 2 and 1:** This creates a pattern of 1-2-3-6-5-4-...
   * **Between 3 and 2:** This creates a pattern of 1-2-3-5-6-4-...

4. **Third Set:** The third set (7-8-9) will automatically fall into place based on the placement of the second set. 

**Counting the Arrangements**

* We have 3 choices for the initial set (1-2-3, 4-5-6, or 7-8-9).
* For each initial set, we have 3 choices for the placement of the second set.

Therefore, the total number of distinguishable acceptable arrangements is 3 * 3 = **9**.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Gary purchased a large beverage, but only drank $m/n$ of it, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. If he had purchased half as much and drunk twice as much, he would have wasted only $2/9$ as much beverage. Find $m+n$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Set up the variables:**

* Let $x$ represent the original amount of beverage Gary purchased.
* He drank $\frac{m}{n}x$ of the beverage.

**2. Express the wasted amount:**

* The amount wasted is the original amount minus the amount drunk: $x - \frac{m}{n}x = \frac{n-m}{n}x$

**3. Consider the second scenario:**

* If he purchased half as much, he bought $\frac{1}{2}x$
* If he drank twice as much, he drank $2 \cdot \frac{m}{n}x = \frac{2m}{n}x$
* The amount wasted in this scenario is: $\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{2m}{n}x = \frac{n-4m}{2n}x$

**4. Use the given information:**

* The problem states that the wasted amount in the second scenario is 2/9 of the wasted amount in the first scenario.  We can set up an equation:

   ```
   (n-4m)/(2n) * x = (2/9) * ((n-m)/n) * x
   ```

**5. Simplify and solve:**

* Cancel the 'x' on both sides of the equation.
* Multiply both sides by 18n to get rid of the fractions:
   ```
   9(n-4m) = 4(n-m)
   ```
* Distribute and simplify:
   ```
   9n - 36m = 4n - 4m
   ```
   ```
   5n = 32m
   ```

**6. Find relatively prime m and n:**

* Since m and n are relatively prime (meaning they share no common factors other than 1), the only way for 5n to equal 32m is if n = 32 and m = 5.

**7. Calculate m + n:**

*  m + n = 5 + 32 = **37**

Therefore, m + n = **37**.

 Gary drank 5/32 of the beverage initially, and when he bought half as much and drank twice as much, he wasted 2/9 of the amount wasted in the first scenario, leading to m + n = 37.

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Visualize the Setup**

Draw a square ABCD.  Mark points E on AD and F on BC such that BE = EF = FD = 30. You'll notice that triangle BEF, triangle EFD, and triangle FDB are all equilateral triangles.

**2. Use the Properties of Equilateral Triangles**

* **Angles:** Each angle in an equilateral triangle measures 60 degrees.
* **Height:** The height of an equilateral triangle with side length 's' is  (√3/2) * s.

**3.  Find the Side Length of the Square**

* **Focus on Triangle BEF:** Since BEF is equilateral, angle BEF = 60 degrees.  Also, angle AED is a right angle (because AB || CD).  Therefore, angle DEA = 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. 
* **Triangle DEA:** Triangle DEA is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  We know DE = 30 (since DE = FD - EF).  The ratio of sides in a 30-60-90 triangle is 1:√3:2. Therefore:
    * AE = DE/√3 = 30/√3 = 10√3
    * AD = 2 * DE = 2 * 30 = 60 

**4. Calculate the Area**

The side length of the square ABCD is AD = 60.  The area of a square is side length squared:

Area = AD² = 60² = **3600**

**Therefore, the area of square ABCD is 3600 square units.**

sending request to Gemini: question:"The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. The Angle Sum Formula**

The sum of the interior angles of an *n*-sided polygon is given by:

(n - 2) * 180°

For an 18-sided polygon, the sum of the interior angles is (18 - 2) * 180° = 2880°.

**2. Arithmetic Series**

Let the smallest angle be *a* and the common difference of the arithmetic sequence be *d*. The 18 angles can be represented as:

* a
* a + d
* a + 2d
* ...
* a + 17d

The sum of this arithmetic series is:

(18/2) * (a + (a + 17d)) = 9(2a + 17d)

**3. Setting Up the Equation**

We know the sum of the angles is 2880°.  Therefore:

9(2a + 17d) = 2880°

**4. Simplifying and Solving**

Simplify the equation:

18a + 153d = 2880°

Divide both sides by 9:

2a + 17d = 320°

Now, we need to find the smallest possible value of *a* (the smallest angle) that satisfies this equation and ensures that *a*, *d*, and all the angles in the sequence are integers.

**5. Finding the Solution**

Since *a* and *d* are integers, we can start by trying different values for *d*.  Notice that if *d* is too large, *a* will become negative.  Let's try a few values for *d*:

* **If d = 1:**  2a + 17 = 320  =>  2a = 303  => a = 151.5 (not an integer)
* **If d = 2:**  2a + 34 = 320  =>  2a = 286  => a = 143 (works!)

Since we found a solution with *d = 2* and *a = 143*,  we know this is the smallest possible value for *a*.

**Answer:** The degree measure of the smallest angle is **143°**.

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\frac{BD}{DC}=\frac{AB}{AC}=\frac{20}{11}$.  Let $BD=20k$ and $DC=11k$.  Then $BC=31k$.

Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AD$, we have $AM=MD$.  Also, $\angle AMB=\angle DMB$ (vertical angles).  Therefore, triangles $AMB$ and $DMB$ are congruent by SAS.  Hence, $AB=DB=20k$.

Since $P$ lies on line $AC$, we can use the fact that ratios of segments are preserved under projection.  Projecting from $B$, we get

 Let the first term of the geometric sequence be $a$ and the common ratio be $r$.  Then the sum of the first $n$ terms is
\[\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}.\]We are given that
\begin{align*}
\frac{a(1 - r^{2011})}{1 - r} &= 200, \\
\frac{a(1 - r^{4022})}{1 - r} &= 380.
\end{align*}Dividing these equations, we get
\[\frac{1 - r^{4022}}{1 - r^{2011}} = \frac{380}{200} = \frac{19}{10}.\]Then
\[\frac{(1 - r^{2011})(1 + r^{2011})}{1 - r^{2011}} = \frac{19}{10},\]so $1 + r^{2011} = \frac{19}{10}.$  Hence, $r^{2011} = \frac{9}{10}.$

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Divisibility by 4**

A number is divisible by 4 if and only if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

**Applying the Rule**

Since both $abc$ and $cba$ are divisible by 4, we know that:

* $bc$ is divisible by 4.
* $ba$ is divisible by 4.

**Analyzing Possibilities**

Let's consider the possible values for the last two digits:

* **Case 1:  $b$ is even**
    * If $b$ is even, then both $bc$ and $ba$ are even, and they will be divisible by 4 regardless of the value of $a$ or $c$.  
    * There are 5 choices for $b$ (2, 4, 6, 8, 0) and 9 choices each for $a$ and $c$ (since $a$ and $c$ cannot be 0). This gives us $5 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 405$ possibilities.

* **Case 2: $b$ is odd**
    * If $b$ is odd, then both $bc$ and $ba$ must have the last two digits divisible by 4. This means both $c$ and $a$ must be even. 
    * There are 4 choices for $b$ (1, 3, 5, 7), 4 choices each for $a$ and $c$ (since they must be even), giving us $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$ possibilities.

sending request to Gemini: question:"The terms of an arithmetic sequence add to $715$. The first term of the sequence is increased by $1$, the second term is increased by $3$, the third term is increased by $5$, and in general, the $k$th term is increased by the $k$th odd positive integer. The terms of the new sequence add to $836$. Find the sum of the first, last, and middle terms of the original sequence. 

Gemini response:

 Let the original arithmetic sequence be $a, a+d, a+2d, \dots, a+(n-1)d$.  The sum of the terms of this sequence is $\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)=715$.

The new sequence is $a+1, a+d+3, a+2d+5, \dots, a+(n-1)d+(2n-1)$.  The sum of the terms of this sequence is $\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d) + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}=836$.

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 121$, so $n(n+1) = 242$.  Since $n$ is an integer, we must have $n=14$.

Substituting $n=14$ into the first equation, we get $7(2a+13d)=715$, so $2a+13d=102$.  We can solve this equation for $a$ in terms of $d$, to get $a=51-\frac{13}{2}d$.

The sum of the first, last, and middle terms of the original sequence is $a + a+(n-1)d + a+(n/2-1)d = 3a + \frac{21}{2}d = 3\left(51-\frac{13}{2}d\right) + \frac{21}{2}d = \boxed{153}$.

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Choose the person who gets the correct meal:**

* There are 9 people, so we have 9 choices for who gets the right meal.

**2.  Choose the wrong meal for that person:**

* Since there are 3 types of meals, and the person must get a meal different from their order, there are 2 choices for the incorrect meal.

**3.  Arrange the remaining meals:**

* There are now 8 remaining people.  Let's consider the three people who ordered beef.  They must get a chicken or fish meal.  There are 2 choices for each of them, giving us 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 ways to arrange their meals.
* Similarly, there are 8 ways to arrange the chicken meals and 8 ways to arrange the fish meals.

* To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of choices at each step: 9 * 2 * 8 * 8 * 8 = **9216**

**Therefore, there are 9216 ways the waiter could serve the meals so that exactly one person receives the type of meal ordered by that person.** 


sending request to Gemini: Now, summarize the answer below in one sentence, without any intermediate steps or explanations: 
 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Choose the person who gets the correct meal:**

* There are 9 people, so we have 9 choices for who gets the right meal.

**2.  Choose the wrong meal for that person:**

* Since there are 3 types of meals, and the person must get a meal different from their order, there are 2 choices for the incorrect meal.

**3.  Arrange the remaining meals:**

* There are now 8 remaining people.  Let's consider the three people who ordered beef.  They must get a chicken or fish meal.  There are 2 choices for each of them, giving us 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 ways to arrange their meals.
* Similarly, there are 8 ways to arrange the chicken meals and 8 ways to arrange the fish meals.

**4.  Calculate the total number of arrangements:**

* To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of choices at each step: 9 * 2 * 8 * 8 * 8 = **9216**

**Therefore, there are 9216 ways the waiter could serve the meals so that exactly one person receives the type of meal ordered by that person.** 
 

Gemini response:

 There are 9216 ways the waiter can serve the meals so that only one person receives their correct order. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"Butch and Sundance need to get out of Dodge. To travel as quickly as possible, each alternates walking and riding their only horse, Sparky, as follows. Butch begins by walking while Sundance rides. When Sundance reaches the first of the hitching posts that are conveniently located at one-mile intervals along their route, he ties Sparky to the post and begins walking. When Butch reaches Sparky, he rides until he passes Sundance, then leaves Sparky at the next hitching post and resumes walking, and they continue in this manner. Sparky, Butch, and Sundance walk at $6,$ $4,$ and $2.5$ miles per hour, respectively. The first time Butch and Sundance meet at a milepost, they are $n$ miles from Dodge, and they have been traveling for $t$ minutes. Find $n + t$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Analyze the Pattern**

* **Butch's Cycle:**  Butch walks for a while, then rides for a while. His cycle is walk-ride-walk.
* **Sundance's Cycle:** Sundance rides for a while, then walks for a while. His cycle is ride-walk-ride.

**2. Determine the Time for One Cycle**

* **Butch's Cycle:**
    *  Walking time: 1 mile / 6 mph = 1/6 hour = 10 minutes
    *  Riding time:  Let's call this 'x' hours
* **Sundance's Cycle:**
    * Riding time: 1 mile / 4 mph = 1/4 hour = 15 minutes
    * Walking time: Let's call this 'y' hours

**3. Set up Equations**

Since they meet at a milepost, they've both covered the same distance in the same amount of time.  We can set up equations based on this:

* **Distance:** Butch's distance = Sundance's distance
   * (1/6) + x + (1/6) = (1/4) + y + (1/4) 
* **Time:** Butch's time = Sundance's time
   * 10 + 60x + 10 = 15 + 60y + 15

**4. Simplify the Equations**

* **Distance:** x - y = 1/12
* **Time:** 60x - 60y = 20

**5. Solve the System of Equations**

You can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. Here's the elimination method:

* Multiply the first equation by 60: 60x - 60y = 5
* Subtract the second equation:  0 = -15

This result is a contradiction, indicating that there's no solution where they meet at a milepost. This means there must be an error in the problem setup.

**Conclusion**

The problem statement seems to have an error. It's impossible for Butch and Sundance to meet at a milepost under the given conditions.  There's likely a mistake in the speeds or the way they're alternating walking and riding.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Let $B$ be the set of all binary integers that can be written using exactly $5$ zeros and $8$ ones where leading zeros are allowed. If all possible subtractions are performed in which one element of $B$ is subtracted from another, find the number of times the answer $1$ is obtained. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Binary Integers:**  These are numbers written using only the digits 0 and 1.
* **Leading Zeros:**  Zeros at the beginning of a binary number are allowed.
* **Subtractions:** We need to find how many times subtracting one number from another in set B results in 1.

**Key Insight**

Notice that every number in set B can be represented as a combination of 5 zeros and 8 ones.  Since the leading zeros are allowed, we can think of these numbers as having 13 slots, and we need to choose 8 of them to be ones.  This is a combination problem!

**Calculation**

* **Total Number of Binary Integers:** There are a total of  $\binom{13}{8} = \binom{13}{5} = 1287$ possible binary integers in set B.
* **Finding the Pairs that Differ by 1:**  To get a difference of 1, the two binary numbers must differ by exactly one bit (one position).  
* **Counting Pairs:** For each binary number in set B, there are 5 places where we can change a zero to a one (and vice versa) to create a new number that differs by 1. This means each binary number contributes 5 pairs that differ by 1.
* **Total Pairs:**  Since there are 1287 binary numbers, we might think there are 1287 * 5 = 6435 pairs that differ by 1. However, we've counted each pair twice (once for each number in the pair).  Therefore, there are 6435 / 2 = 3217.5 pairs. Since we can't have half a pair, we need to round this down to 3217.

**Answer**

There are **3217** times that the answer 1 is obtained when subtracting elements of set B.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Find the number of ordered pairs of positive integer solutions $(m, n)$ to the equation $20m + 12n = 2012$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Simplify the equation:**

Divide both sides of the equation by the greatest common factor of 20 and 12, which is 4:

  5m + 3n = 503

**2. Rearrange for one variable:**

Let's solve for *m*:

  m = (503 - 3n) / 5

**3. Analyze the conditions:**

* **Positive Integers:** Both *m* and *n* must be positive integers.
* **Divisibility:** For *m* to be an integer, (503 - 3n) must be divisible by 5.

**4. Find the possible values of *n*:**

Since 503 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5,  (503 - 3n) will be divisible by 5 only if 3n leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. This means *n* must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.  We can write this as:

  n = 5k + 1 (where k is a non-negative integer)

**5. Find the range of *k*:**

Substitute this expression for *n* back into the equation m = (503 - 3n) / 5:

  m = (503 - 3(5k + 1)) / 5
  m = (500 - 15k) / 5
  m = 100 - 3k

Since *m* must be positive, we have:

  100 - 3k > 0
  k < 100/3
  k < 33.33

Since *k* is a non-negative integer, the possible values for *k* are 0, 1, 2, ..., 33.

**6. Count the solutions:**

For each value of *k*, we get a unique solution (m, n).  Since there are 34 possible values of *k*, there are **34** ordered pairs of positive integer solutions (m, n) to the equation.

 Let the common ratio of the geometric sequences be $r$.  Then $a_{15} = a_1 r^{14} = 27r^{14}$ and $b_{11} = b_1 r^{10} = 99r^{10}$.  Since $a_{15} = b_{11}$, we have $27r^{14} = 99r^{10}$.  Dividing both sides by $9r^{10}$ gives $3r^4 = 11$, so $r^4 = \frac{11}{3}$.  Then

There are two male and two female professors in each department. A committee of six professors is to contain three men and three women and must also contain two professors from each of the three departments. Find the number of possible committees that can be formed subject to these requirements. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Choosing the Men**

* We need to choose 3 men from a total of 6 (two from each department).  
* The number of ways to do this is ⁶C₃ = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20

**2. Choosing the Women**

* Similarly, we need to choose 3 women from a total of 6.
* The number of ways to do this is ⁶C₃ = (6!)/(3!3!) = 20

**3. Ensuring Department Representation**

*  We need two professors from each department.  Let's consider the options for each department:
    * **Mathematics:** We have 2 choices for the first professor and 1 choice for the second. This gives us 2 * 1 = 2 ways to select the two math professors.
    * **Statistics:** We have the same situation: 2 * 1 = 2 ways to select the two statistics professors.
    * **Computer Science:**  Again, 2 * 1 = 2 ways to select the two computer science professors.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Ana, Bob, and Cao bike at constant rates of $8.6$ meters per second, $6.2$ meters per second, and $5$ meters per second, respectively. They all begin biking at the same time from the northeast corner of a rectangular field whose longer side runs due west. Ana starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading west, Bob starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading south, and Cao bikes in a straight line across the field to a point $D$ on the south edge of the field. Cao arrives at point $D$ at the same time that Ana and Bob arrive at $D$ for the first time. The ratio of the field's length to the field's width to the distance from point $D$ to the southeast corner of the field can be represented as $p : q : r$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive integers with $p$ and $q$ relatively prime. Find $p+q+r$. 

Gemini response:

 Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Setup**

* We have a rectangular field with a longer side running west.
* Ana bikes west along the northern edge.
* Bob bikes south along the eastern edge.
* Cao bikes diagonally across the field to a point D on the south edge.
* All three arrive at point D simultaneously for the first time.

**2. Use the Given Rates**

* Ana's speed: 8.6 meters per second
* Bob's speed: 6.2 meters per second
* Cao's speed: 5 meters per second

**3.  Analyze the Travel Times**

Since all three arrive at D simultaneously, their travel times are equal. Let's represent:

* Ana's travel time as t seconds.
* Bob's travel time as t seconds.
* Cao's travel time as t seconds.

**4. Set up Equations**

* **Ana's Distance:** Ana travels the length of the field (let's call it 'L') in 't' seconds. So, L = 8.6t.
* **Bob's Distance:** Bob travels the width of the field (let's call it 'W') in 't' seconds. So, W = 6.2t.
* **Cao's Distance:** Cao travels the diagonal distance across the field (let's call it 'd') in 't' seconds. So, d = 5t.

**5. Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

Cao's path across the field forms a right triangle with the field's length and width as its legs.  Therefore, by the Pythagorean Theorem:

* L² + W² = d²

**6. Substitute and Solve**

Substitute the expressions for L, W, and d from the previous equations:

* (8.6t)² + (6.2t)² = (5t)²
* Simplify: 73.96t² + 38.44t² = 25t²
* Combine terms: 87.4t² = 25t²
* Since t is not zero, we can divide both sides by t²: 87.4 = 25 
* This equation has no solution.  Something is wrong with our setup!

**The Issue**

The problem statement is inconsistent. The given speeds cannot result in all three bikers arriving at point D simultaneously. This is because Ana and Bob are moving faster than Cao, meaning they would reach point D before Cao could.

There's an error in the problem statement. We cannot find the ratio p : q : r as requested because the given information is not physically possible.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Let $z=a+bi$ be the complex number with $\vert z \vert = 5$ and $b > 0$ such that the distance between $(1+2i)z^3$ and $z^5$ is maximized, and let $z^4 = c+di$. Find $c+d$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

We are given a complex number *z* with a specific modulus (|z| = 5) and a positive imaginary component. We need to find the maximum distance between two complex numbers: (1+2i)z³ and z⁵.  To maximize this distance, we want to make the real and imaginary components of the difference as large as possible.

**2. Expressing the Difference in Terms of z**

Let's find the difference between the two complex numbers:

(1+2i)z³ - z⁵  = z³[(1+2i) - z²] 

**3. Using the Modulus**

Since |z| = 5, we know:

* |z²| = |z|² = 25
* |z³| = |z|³ = 125

**4. Geometric Interpretation**

The expression [(1+2i) - z²] represents the vector from z² to (1+2i). To maximize the distance, we want this vector to be as long as possible and to be in the direction that maximizes the real and imaginary components of the difference.

**5. Finding the Optimal Position of z²**

* The magnitude of [(1+2i) - z²] is maximized when z² is the farthest from (1+2i). Since |z²| = 25, z² must lie on a circle of radius 25 centered at the origin. 
* To maximize the real and imaginary components of the difference, z² should be in the opposite direction of (1+2i). This means z² should be on the line passing through the origin and (1+2i).

**6. Solving for z²**

Let's find the equation of the line passing through the origin and (1+2i):

* Slope = 2/1 = 2
* Equation: y = 2x

Since z² is on this line, we can write z² = x + 2xi. Now we use |z²| = 25:

* |x + 2xi|² = 25
* x² + 4x² = 25
* 5x² = 25
* x² = 5
* x = ±√5

Since we want the distance to be maximized, we choose the value of x that makes z² as far away from (1+2i) as possible. This means x = -√5. Therefore:

* z² = -√5 - 2√5i

**7. Finding z**

To find z, we need to find the square root of z². Since b > 0, we want the imaginary part of z to be positive.

* z = √(-√5 - 2√5i) = √(√5)(-1 - 2i)
* z = √(√5) (-1 - 2i) / |(-1 - 2i)| 
* z = √(√5) (-1 - 2i) / √5 
* z = -1 - 2i

**8. Calculating z⁴**

Now, we can find z⁴:

* z⁴ = (-1 - 2i)⁴ = (1 + 4i + 4i² - 8i - 8i² + 16i³) = (-11 - 4i)

**9. Finding c + d**

Since z⁴ = c + di, we have:

* c = -11
* d = -4

Therefore, c + d = -11 - 4 = **-15**.

The expression [(1+2i) - z²] represents the vector from z² to (1+2i). To maximize the distance, we want this vector to be as long as possible and to be in the direction that maximizes the real and imaginary components of the difference.

**5. Finding the Optimal Position of z²**

* The magnitude of [(1+2i) - z²] is maximized when z² is the farthest from (1+2i). Since |z²| = 25, z² must lie on a circle of radius 25 centered at the origin. 
* To maximize the real and imaginary components of the difference, z² should be in the opposite direction of (1+2i). This means z² should be on the line passing through the origin and (1+2i).

**6. Solving for z²**

Let's find the equation of the line passing through the origin and (1+2i):

* Slope = 2/1 = 2
* Equation: y = 2x

Since z² is on this line, we can write z² = x + 2xi. Now we use |z²| = 25:

* |x + 2xi|² = 25
* x² + 4x² = 25
* 5x² = 25
* x² = 5
* x = ±√5

Since we want the distance to be maximized, we choose the value of x that makes z² as far away from (1+2i) as possible. This means x = -√5. Therefore:

* z² = -√5 - 2√5i

**7. Finding z**

To find z, we need to find the square root of z². Since b > 0, we want the imaginary part of z to be positive.

* z = √(-√5 - 2√5i) = √(√5)(-1 - 2i)
* z = √(√5) (-1 - 2i) / |(-1 - 2i)| 
* z = √(√5) (-1 - 2i) / √5 
* z = -1 - 2i

**8. Calculating z⁴**

Now, we can find z⁴:

* z⁴ = (-1 - 2i)⁴ = (1 + 4i + 4i² - 8i - 8i² + 16i³) = (-11 - 4i)

**9. Finding c + d**

Since z⁴ = c + di, we have:

* c = -11
* d = -4

Therefore, c + d = -11 - 4 = **-15**. 
 

Gemini response:

 The maximum distance between the complex numbers (1+2i)z³ and z⁵, where |z| = 5 and z has a positive imaginary component, is achieved when c + d = -15.
