sending request to Gemini: question:"Call a $3$-digit number geometric if it has $3$ distinct digits which, when read from left to right, form a geometric sequence. Find the difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding Geometric Sequences**

A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor called the common ratio.  

**Finding Geometric Numbers**

Let the first digit of our geometric number be *a*. Since the digits form a geometric sequence, the second digit must be *ar* and the third digit must be *ar²*, where *r* is the common ratio.

To be a 3-digit number, the first digit *a* must be between 1 and 9. The common ratio *r* must also be positive, otherwise, we would get negative digits.

**Finding the Largest and Smallest Geometric Numbers**

* **Largest:** To maximize the number, we want to make *a* and *r* as large as possible. The largest possible value for *a* is 9.  To maximize *r*, we want the difference between the digits to be as large as possible, which occurs when *r* is slightly less than 10.  The largest possible geometric number is then 998.

* **Smallest:** To minimize the number, we want to make *a* as small as possible (1) and *r* as small as possible. The smallest possible value for *r* is slightly greater than 1. The smallest possible geometric number is 124.

**The Difference**

The difference between the largest and smallest geometric numbers is 998 - 124 = **874**.

sending request to Gemini: question:"There is a complex number $z$ with imaginary part $164$ and a positive integer $n$ such that \[\frac {z}{z + n} = 4i.\] Find $n$. 

Gemini response:

 Let $z = a + 164i,$ where $a$ is a real number.  Then
\[\frac{a + 164i}{a + 164i + n} = 4i.\]Multiplying both sides by $a + 164i + n,$ we get
\[a + 164i = 4i(a + 164i + n).\]This simplifies to $a + 164i = -656 + 4ai + 4in.$  Equating real and imaginary parts, we get
\begin{align*}
a &= -656 + 4an, \\
164 &= 4a + 4n.
\end{align*}From the second equation, $a = 41 - n.$  Substituting into the first equation, we get
\[41 - n = -656 + 4(41 - n)n.\]This simplifies to $4n^2 - 165n + 737 = 0,$ which factors as $(n - 1)(4n - 737) = 0.$  Thus, $n = \boxed{1}$ or $n = \frac{737}{4},$ but $n$ must be a positive integer, so $n = 1.$

 The value of $n$ that satisfies the given equation is 1. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"A coin that comes up heads with probability $p > 0$ and tails with probability $1 - p > 0$ independently on each flip is flipped $8$ times. Suppose that the probability of three heads and five tails is equal to $\frac {1}{25}$ of the probability of five heads and three tails. Let $p = \frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Set up the probabilities**

* The probability of getting three heads and five tails is:  
  ${8 \choose 3} p^3 (1-p)^5 = 56p^3(1-p)^5$
* The probability of getting five heads and three tails is:
  ${8 \choose 5} p^5 (1-p)^3 = 56p^5(1-p)^3$

**2. Use the given information**

We are told that the probability of three heads and five tails is $\frac{1}{25}$ of the probability of five heads and three tails:

 $$56p^3(1-p)^5 = \frac{1}{25} \cdot 56p^5(1-p)^3$$

**3. Simplify the equation**

Cancel the common factor of $56p^3(1-p)^3$:

$$(1-p)^2 = \frac{1}{25} p^2$$

**4. Solve for p**

* Expand the left side: $1 - 2p + p^2 = \frac{1}{25}p^2$
* Move all terms to one side: $\frac{24}{25}p^2 - 2p + 1 = 0$
* Multiply both sides by 25: $24p^2 - 50p + 25 = 0$
* Factor the quadratic: $(4p-5)(6p-5) = 0$
* This gives us two possible solutions: $p = \frac{5}{4}$ or $p = \frac{5}{6}$. 

Since $p$ must be between 0 and 1, the only valid solution is $p = \frac{5}{6}$.

**5. Find m + n**

We have $p = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, $m + n = 5 + 6 = \boxed{11}$.

 The probability of getting heads on a single toss of a coin is $\frac{5}{6}$, and the sum of the numerator and denominator of this probability is 11.

Since $\frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{17}{1000}$ and $\frac{AN}{AD} = \frac{17}{2009}$, we can write $AM = \frac{17}{1000}AB$ and $AN = \frac{17}{2009}AD$.  Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $AB = CD$ and $AD = BC$, so
\begin{align*}
AM &= \frac{17}{1000} CD, \\
AN &= \frac{17}{2009} BC.
\end{align*}Now, consider triangles $AMP$ and $CPD$.  Since $AM$ is parallel to $CD$, we have $\angle AMP = \angle CPD$.  Also, $\angle MAP = \angle PCD$, because they are alternate interior angles.  Therefore, triangles $AMP$ and $CPD$ are similar.

Since triangles $AMP$ and $CPD$ are similar,
\[\frac{AP}{CP} = \frac{AM}{CD} = \frac{17}{1000}.\]Since triangles $ANP$ and $BCP$ are similar,
\[\frac{AP}{CP} = \frac{AN}{BC} = \frac{17}{2009}.\]Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we have

Since $AK = CK$, triangle $AKC$ is isosceles, and $\angle KAC = \angle KCA$.  Since $CL$ is the angle bisector of $\angle C$, $\angle KCL = \angle LCB$.  Then $\angle KAC = \angle KCA = \angle KCL = \angle LCB$.

Since $\angle KAC = \angle KCL$, $AC$ is parallel to $CL$.  Then $\angle ABC = \angle BCL$ (alternate interior angles), so $\triangle BCL$ is isosceles with $BL = BC = 300$.  Also, $\triangle AMK$ is isosceles with $AM = MK = 180$.

Let $x = LP$.  Then $BP = 300 - x$.  Since $K$ is the midpoint of $\overline{PM}$, $PK = KM = 180 + x$.

Since $\triangle BPK$ and $\triangle BCL$ are similar,
\[\frac{BP}{BK} = \frac{BL}{BC}.\]Then
\[\frac{300 - x}{180 + x + 180} = \frac{300}{300 + 450},\]which simplifies to $\frac{300 - x}{360 + x} = \frac{2}{5}$.  Solving, we find $x = \boxed{60}$.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Before starting to paint, Bill had $130$ ounces of blue paint, $164$ ounces of red paint, and $188$ ounces of white paint. Bill painted four equally sized stripes on a wall, making a blue stripe, a red stripe, a white stripe, and a pink stripe. Pink is a mixture of red and white, not necessarily in equal amounts. When Bill finished, he had equal amounts of blue, red, and white paint left. Find the total number of ounces of paint Bill had left. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Figure out the paint used for each stripe:**

* Since Bill had equal amounts of blue, red, and white paint left, he must have used the same amount of each color for the stripes.
* Let's call the amount of each color used for a stripe "x" ounces.

**2. Set up equations for the paint used:**

* **Blue:**  130 (initial amount) - x =  amount left
* **Red:** 164 (initial amount) - x = amount left - y (amount used for pink)
* **White:** 188 (initial amount) - x = amount left - (x - y) (amount used for pink)

**3. Use the information about equal amounts left:**

* Since Bill had equal amounts of each color left, we know:
    * 130 - x = 164 - x - y
    * 130 - x = 188 - x - (x - y)

**4. Solve for "x" and "y":**

* Simplifying the first equation: 34 = y  (This means 34 ounces of red were used to make pink)
* Simplifying the second equation: 58 = x - y  
* Substitute y = 34 into the second equation: 58 = x - 34
* Solve for x: x = 92 (This means 92 ounces of each color were used for a stripe)

**5. Calculate the total amount of paint left:**

* Blue: 130 - 92 = 38 ounces
* Red: 164 - 92 - 34 = 38 ounces
* White: 188 - 92 - (92 - 34) = 38 ounces

**6. Find the total paint left:**

* Total paint left: 38 + 38 + 38 = **114 ounces**

**Answer:** Bill had a total of 114 ounces of paint left.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Suppose that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive real numbers such that $a^{\log_3 7} = 27$, $b^{\log_7 11} = 49$, and $c^{\log_{11}25} = \sqrt{11}$. Find\[a^{(\log_3 7)^2} + b^{(\log_7 11)^2} + c^{(\log_{11} 25)^2}.\] 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Simplify the given equations**

*  From $a^{\log_3 7} = 27 = 3^3$, we get  
    $a^{\log_3 7} = 3^{\log_3 27} \Rightarrow a = 3^{\frac{\log_3 27}{\log_3 7}} = 3^{\log_7 27}$.
* From $b^{\log_7 11} = 49 = 7^2$, we get 
    $b^{\log_7 11} = 7^{\log_7 49} \Rightarrow b = 7^{\frac{\log_7 49}{\log_7 11}} = 7^{\log_{11} 49}$.
* From $c^{\log_{11} 25} = \sqrt{11} = 11^{\frac{1}{2}}$, we get
    $c^{\log_{11} 25} = 11^{\log_{11} \sqrt{11}} \Rightarrow c = 11^{\frac{\log_{11} \sqrt{11}}{\log_{11} 25}} = 11^{\log_{25} \sqrt{11}}$.

**2. Substitute into the expression**

Now we can substitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the expression we want to find:

\begin{align*}
a^{(\log_3 7)^2} + b^{(\log_7 11)^2} + c^{(\log_{11} 25)^2} &= \left(3^{\log_7 27}\right)^{(\log_3 7)^2} + \left(7^{\log_{11} 49}\right)^{(\log_7 11)^2} + \left(11^{\log_{25} \sqrt{11}}\right)^{(\log_{11} 25)^2} \\
&= 3^{\log_7 27 \cdot (\log_3 7)^2} + 7^{\log_{11} 49 \cdot (\log_7 11)^2} + 11^{\log_{25} \sqrt{11} \cdot (\log_{11} 25)^2}
\end{align*}

**3. Use the change-of-base formula**

Recall the change-of-base formula for logarithms: $\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}$  (where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive and $a$ and $c$ are not equal to 1).

We can use this formula to simplify the exponents:

* $\log_7 27 \cdot (\log_3 7)^2 = \frac{\log_3 27}{\log_3 7} \cdot \left(\frac{\log_3 7}{\log_3 3}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1^2} = 3$
* $\log_{11} 49 \cdot (\log_7 11)^2 = \frac{\log_7 49}{\log_7 11} \cdot \left(\frac{\log_7 11}{\log_7 7}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1^2} = 2$
* $\log_{25} \sqrt{11} \cdot (\log_{11} 25)^2 = \frac{\log_{11} \sqrt{11}}{\log_{11} 25} \cdot \left(\frac{\log_{11} 25}{\log_{11} 11}\right)^2 = \frac{1/2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{1^2} = \frac{1}{4}$

**4. Final Calculation**

Substituting these simplified exponents back into the expression, we get:

$3^{\log_7 27 \cdot (\log_3 7)^2} + 7^{\log_{11} 49 \cdot (\log_7 11)^2} + 11^{\log_{25} \sqrt{11} \cdot (\log_{11} 25)^2} = 3^3 + 7^2 + 11^{1/4} = \boxed{27 + 49 + \sqrt[4]{11}}$.

a^{(\log_3 7)^2} + b^{(\log_7 11)^2} + c^{(\log_{11} 25)^2} &= \left(3^{\log_7 27}\right)^{(\log_3 7)^2} + \left(7^{\log_{11} 49}\right)^{(\log_7 11)^2} + \left(11^{\log_{25} \sqrt{11}}\right)^{(\log_{11} 25)^2} \\
&= 3^{\log_7 27 \cdot (\log_3 7)^2} + 7^{\log_{11} 49 \cdot (\log_7 11)^2} + 11^{\log_{25} \sqrt{11} \cdot (\log_{11} 25)^2}
\end{align*}

**3. Use the change-of-base formula**

Recall the change-of-base formula for logarithms: $\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}$  (where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive and $a$ and $c$ are not equal to 1).

We can use this formula to simplify the exponents:

* $\log_7 27 \cdot (\log_3 7)^2 = \frac{\log_3 27}{\log_3 7} \cdot \left(\frac{\log_3 7}{\log_3 3}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1^2} = 3$
* $\log_{11} 49 \cdot (\log_7 11)^2 = \frac{\log_7 49}{\log_7 11} \cdot \left(\frac{\log_7 11}{\log_7 7}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{1^2} = 2$
* $\log_{25} \sqrt{11} \cdot (\log_{11} 25)^2 = \frac{\log_{11} \sqrt{11}}{\log_{11} 25} \cdot \left(\frac{\log_{11} 25}{\log_{11} 11}\right)^2 = \frac{1/2}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{1^2} = \frac{1}{4}$

**4. Final Calculation**

Substituting these simplified exponents back into the expression, we get:

$3^{\log_7 27 \cdot (\log_3 7)^2} + 7^{\log_{11} 49 \cdot (\log_7 11)^2} + 11^{\log_{25} \sqrt{11} \cdot (\log_{11} 25)^2} = 3^3 + 7^2 + 11^{1/4} = \boxed{27 + 49 + \sqrt[4]{11}}$. 
 

Gemini response:

 The value of the expression $a^{(\log_3 7)^2} + b^{(\log_7 11)^2} + c^{(\log_{11} 25)^2}$ is $27 + 49 + \sqrt[4]{11}$. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"In rectangle $ABCD$, $AB=100$. Let $E$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$. Given that line $AC$ and line $BE$ are perpendicular, find the greatest integer less than $AD$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

[asy]
unitsize(0.4 cm);

pair A, B, C, D, E;

A = (0,8);
B = (0,0);
C = (10,0);
D = (10,8);
E = (D + A)/2;

draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);
draw(A--C);
draw(B--E);

label("$A$", A, NW);
label("$B$", B, SW);
label("$C$", C, SE);
label("$D$", D, NE);
label("$E$", E, NE);
label("$100$", (B + C)/2, S);
[/asy]

Let $AD = x$. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$, we have $AE = DE = x/2$.  Also, since $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $AB = CD = 100$.

Since lines $AC$ and $BE$ are perpendicular, we know that $\triangle ABE$ is a right triangle with right angle at $E$.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on this triangle:

$$AB^2 = AE^2 + BE^2$$

Substituting the known values, we get:

$$100^2 = \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + BE^2$$

To find $BE$, we can consider triangle $BCE$.  Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle, we know $\angle BCE = 90^\circ$.  Also, $\angle BEC = 90^\circ$ since lines $AC$ and $BE$ are perpendicular.  Therefore, $\triangle BCE$ is also a right triangle.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem on this triangle:

$$BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2$$

Substituting $BC = AD = x$ and $CE = \frac{x}{2}$ (since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$), we get:

$$x^2 = BE^2 + \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2$$

Solving for $BE^2$, we get:

$$BE^2 = \frac{3}{4}x^2$$

Now, we can substitute this value of $BE^2$ back into the equation we got from the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ABE$:

$$100^2 = \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}x^2$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$10000 = \frac{4}{4}x^2 = x^2$$

Therefore, $x = \sqrt{10000} = 100$.  Since the greatest integer less than $AD = 100$ is $\boxed{99}$, that is our final answer.

Let $AD = x$. Since $E$ is the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$, we have $AE = DE = x/2$.  Also, since $ABCD$ is a rectangle, $AB = CD = 100$.

Substituting $BC = AD = x$ and $CE = \frac{x}{2}$ (since $E$ is the midpoint of $AD$), we get:

$$x^2 = BE^2 + \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2$$

Solving for $BE^2$, we get:

$$BE^2 = \frac{3}{4}x^2$$

Now, we can substitute this value of $BE^2$ back into the equation we got from the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $ABE$:

$$100^2 = \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{4}x^2$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$10000 = \frac{4}{4}x^2 = x^2$$

Therefore, $x = \sqrt{10000} = 100$.  Since the greatest integer less than $AD = 100$ is $\boxed{99}$, that is our final answer. 
 

Gemini response:

 The greatest integer less than the length of side AD in the given rectangle is 99. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"A group of children held a grape-eating contest. When the contest was over, the winner had eaten $n$ grapes, and the child in $k$-th place had eaten $n+2-2k$ grapes. The total number of grapes eaten in the contest was $2009$. Find the smallest possible value of $n$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Pattern**

The number of grapes eaten by each child follows a pattern:

* 1st place:  n
* 2nd place: n + 2 - 2(2) = n - 2
* 3rd place: n + 2 - 2(3) = n - 4
* 4th place: n + 2 - 2(4) = n - 6
* ... and so on.

Notice that each child in a lower position eats 2 fewer grapes than the child above them.

**Setting Up the Equation**

Let's say there are 'm' children in the contest.  The total number of grapes eaten can be represented as the sum of an arithmetic series:

Total grapes = (n + (n - 2) + (n - 4) + ... + (n - 2(m - 1)) )

Since the total grapes is 2009, we have:

2009 = (n + (n - 2) + (n - 4) + ... + (n - 2(m - 1)) )

**Simplifying the Equation**

We can simplify the equation using the sum of an arithmetic series formula:

* Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)

In our case:

* First term = n
* Last term = n - 2(m - 1)

Therefore:

2009 = (m/2) * (n + (n - 2(m - 1)))

**Finding the Smallest Possible 'n'**

To minimize 'n', we need to maximize the number of children ('m').  We can do this by trying out different values of 'm' and seeing if we get a whole number for 'n'.  

Let's start with a large value of 'm':

* **If m = 40:**
   * 2009 = (40/2) * (n + (n - 2(40 - 1)))
   * 2009 = 20 * (2n - 78)
   * n = 69.45 (not a whole number)

* **If m = 39:**
   * 2009 = (39/2) * (n + (n - 2(39 - 1)))
   * 2009 = 19.5 * (2n - 76)
   * n = 67 (a whole number!)

**Answer**

The smallest possible value of 'n' is **67**.

Let $O$ be the center of circle $A$. Let the points of tangency of circles $B$, $C$, and $D$ with circle $A$ be $P$, $Q$, and $R$, respectively. Let $E$ be the center of circle $E$.

Since $T$ is equilateral, $\angle AOB = \angle BOC = \angle COA = 120^\circ$.  Therefore, $\angle POQ = \angle QOR = \angle ROP = 120^\circ$.

Also, $OP = 10 - 3 = 7$, $OQ = 10 - 2 = 8$, and $OR = 10 - 2 = 8$.

Since $B$, $C$, and $D$ are all externally tangent to circle $E$, we have $BE = 3 + OE$, $CE = 2 + OE$, and $DE = 2 + OE$.

Consider triangle $POE$.  We have $PO = 7$, $PE = 3 + OE$, and $\angle POE = 60^\circ$.  By the Law of Cosines,
\[(3 + OE)^2 = 7^2 + OE^2 - 2 \cdot 7 \cdot OE \cdot \cos 60^\circ.\]This simplifies to $OE^2 - OE - 18 = 0$, which factors as $(OE - 6)(OE + 3) = 0$.  Since $OE$ is positive, $OE = 6$.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Maya lists all the positive divisors of $2010^2$. She then randomly selects two distinct divisors from this list. Let $p$ be the probability that exactly one of the selected divisors is a perfect square. The probability $p$ can be expressed in the form $\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$. 

Gemini response:

 First, we prime factorize $2010^2$:  \[2010^2 = (2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot67)^2 = 2^2\cdot3^2\cdot5^2\cdot67^2.\]To form a divisor of $2010^2$, we can choose any power of 2 from 0 to 2, any power of 3 from 0 to 2, any power of 5 from 0 to 2, and any power of 67 from 0 to 2.  This gives us $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3^4 = 81$ total divisors.

A divisor of $2010^2$ is a perfect square if and only if all of its exponents are even.  There are $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2^4 = 16$ perfect squares that divide $2010^2$.

We now count the number of ways to choose two divisors such that exactly one is a perfect square.  There are 16 perfect squares and 81 - 16 = 65 non-perfect squares.  We can choose one perfect square and one non-perfect square in $16\cdot65 = 1040$ ways.  However, we have counted each pair twice (once for each order), so there are $1040/2 = 520$ ways to choose two divisors, exactly one of which is a perfect square.

The probability of this event is then $\frac{520}{81\cdot80} = \frac{13}{162}$, and $13 + 162 = \boxed{175}$.

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Substitute**

Since we know  $y = \frac{3}{4}x$, substitute this into the equation $x^y = y^x$:

$$x^{\frac{3}{4}x} = \left(\frac{3}{4}x\right)^x$$

**2. Simplify**

Simplify the right side of the equation:

$$x^{\frac{3}{4}x} = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^x \cdot x^x$$

**3. Manipulate Exponents**

To make the exponents easier to work with, raise both sides of the equation to the power of $\frac{4}{3}$:

$$\left(x^{\frac{3}{4}x}\right)^{\frac{4}{3}} = \left[\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^x \cdot x^x\right]^{\frac{4}{3}}$$

This simplifies to:

$$x^x = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\frac{4}{3}x} \cdot x^{\frac{4}{3}x}$$

**4. Solve for x**

Divide both sides by $x^{\frac{4}{3}x}$:

$$x^{x - \frac{4}{3}x} = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\frac{4}{3}x}$$

Simplify:

$$x^{\frac{-1}{3}x} = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\frac{4}{3}x}$$

Since the bases are different, the exponents must be equal:

$$\frac{-1}{3}x = \frac{4}{3}x$$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$$x = 0$$

**5. Find y**

Substitute $x = 0$ back into the equation $y = \frac{3}{4}x$:

$$y = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 0 = 0$$

**6. Calculate x + y**

Finally, calculate $x + y$:

$$x + y = 0 + 0 = 0$$

**7. Express as a Rational Number**

Since 0 can be expressed as the rational number $\frac{0}{1}$, we have $r = 0$ and $s = 1$.

**8. Find r + s**

Therefore, $r + s = 0 + 1 = \boxed{1}$.

 The solution to the equation $x^y = y^x$ with the condition $y = \frac{3}{4}x$ is $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, resulting in $x + y = 1$. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"Jackie and Phil have two fair coins and a third coin that comes up heads with probability $\frac47$.

Let $\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that Jackie gets the same number of heads as Phil, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$. 

Gemini response:

 We can solve this problem by considering cases based on the number of heads Jackie flips.

**Case 1: Jackie flips 0 heads**

* The probability Jackie flips 0 heads is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \frac{3}{28}$.
* For Phil to also flip 0 heads, he needs to flip tails on all three coins, with probability $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \frac{3}{28}$.

**Case 2: Jackie flips 1 head**

*  There are three ways this can happen: (H,T,T), (T,H,T), (T,T,H). Each of these has probability $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \frac{3}{28}$.
* For Phil to also flip 1 head, he needs to flip one head and two tails, which can also happen in three ways with a probability of $\frac{3}{28}$ for each.

**Case 3: Jackie flips 2 heads**

* There are three ways this can happen: (H,H,T), (H,T,H), (T,H,H). Each of these has probability $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{7} = \frac{1}{7}$.

Adding up the probabilities of each case where Jackie and Phil get the same number of heads, we have:

$\frac{3}{28} \cdot \frac{3}{28} + 3 \cdot \frac{3}{28} \cdot \frac{3}{28} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{9 + 27 + 21 + 3}{28^2} = \frac{60}{784} = \frac{15}{196}$.

Therefore, $m + n = 15 + 196 = \boxed{211}$.

 We can solve this problem by considering cases based on the number of heads Jackie flips.

**Case 1: Jackie flips 0 heads**

* The probability Jackie flips 0 heads is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \frac{3}{28}$.
* For Phil to also flip 0 heads, he needs to flip tails on all three coins, with probability $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \frac{3}{28}$.

* For Phil to also flip 3 heads, he needs to flip heads on all three coins, with probability $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{7} = \frac{1}{7}$.

Adding up the probabilities of each case where Jackie and Phil get the same number of heads, we have:

$\frac{3}{28} \cdot \frac{3}{28} + 3 \cdot \frac{3}{28} \cdot \frac{3}{28} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{9 + 27 + 21 + 3}{28^2} = \frac{60}{784} = \frac{15}{196}$.

Therefore, $m + n = 15 + 196 = \boxed{211}$.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ satisfy $a > b > c > d$, $a + b + c + d = 2010$, and $a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - d^2 = 2010$. Find the number of possible values of $a$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**Factoring and Simplification**

* **Difference of squares:** Notice that we can factor the second equation:  
  (a² - b²) + (c² - d²) = 2010
  (a + b)(a - b) + (c + d)(c - d) = 2010

* **Substitute:** Let's use the first equation to make a substitution.  Since a + b + c + d = 2010, we know that a + b = 2010 - (c + d).  Substituting this into our factored equation:
  (2010 - (c + d))(a - b) + (c + d)(c - d) = 2010

* **Simplify:**  Expanding and rearranging terms:
   2010(a - b) - (c + d)(a - b) + (c + d)(c - d) = 2010
   2010(a - b) - (c + d)(a - b - c + d) = 2010
   2010(a - b) - (c + d)(a - d - b + c) = 2010
   2010(a - b) - (c + d)((a - d) - (b - c)) = 2010

* **Further Simplification:**  Since a > b > c > d, we know that (a - d) > (b - c), meaning (a - d) - (b - c) is a positive integer.  Let's call this positive integer 'k':
    2010(a - b) - (c + d)k = 2010

**Analyzing the Equation**

* **Factors of 2010:** The equation tells us that 2010 must be divisible by both (a - b) and k.  Let's find the prime factorization of 2010:  2010 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 67.

* **Possible values of (a - b):**  Since a > b, (a - b) is a positive integer. The possible values of (a - b) are the factors of 2010.

* **Possible values of k:** For each value of (a - b), the corresponding value of k will be a factor of 2010 divided by (a - b).

**Finding the Number of Values of 'a'**

Let's consider the factors of 2010 and see how many distinct values of 'a' we get:

* **(a - b) = 1:** This leads to k = 2010, and we can find a, b, c, d to satisfy the conditions.
* **(a - b) = 2:** This leads to k = 1005, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 3:** This leads to k = 670, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 5:** This leads to k = 402, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 6:** This leads to k = 335, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 10:** This leads to k = 201, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 15:** This leads to k = 134, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 30:** This leads to k = 67, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 67:** This leads to k = 30, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 1005:** This leads to k = 2, and we can find a, b, c, d.
* **(a - b) = 2010:** This leads to k = 1, and we can find a, b, c, d.

Notice that for each value of (a - b), we get a unique value of 'a' (since the other variables are determined by the given conditions). Therefore, there are **11** possible values of 'a'.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Let $N$ be the greatest integer multiple of $36$ all of whose digits are even and no two of whose digits are the same. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**Understanding the Constraints**

* **Multiple of 36:**  A number is divisible by 36 if it's divisible by both 4 and 9.
* **Even digits:**  The digits must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
* **Distinct digits:** No digit can be repeated.

**Finding the Largest Number**

To maximize the number, we want to arrange the digits in descending order.  Since the number must be divisible by 4, the last two digits must form a number divisible by 4.  The largest such number we can form with distinct even digits is 84.

Now we need to add digits to the left to make the number divisible by 9.  The sum of the digits in 84 is 12.  To make the sum divisible by 9, we need to add 6.  

Therefore, the largest number that meets all the conditions is 684.

**Finding the Remainder**

Since the last three digits of 684 are 684, the remainder when 684 is divided by 1000 is simply **684**. 

**Answer:** The remainder when *N* is divided by 1000 is **684**.

* Area of each smaller square: $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}$
* Area of all four smaller squares: $4 \cdot \frac{1}{25} = \frac{4}{25}$
* Area of the shaded region: $1 - \frac{4}{25} = \frac{21}{25}$

Since we're choosing a point randomly within the unit square, the probability of choosing a point in the shaded region is the ratio of the shaded area to the total area:

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Setup**

* **Gates:** There are 12 gates in a straight line.
* **Distance:** The distance between each gate is 100 feet.
* **Randomness:** Dave's initial and final gate assignments are random.

**Finding the Favorable Cases**

To walk 400 feet or less, Dave needs to move to a gate that is at most four gates away from his original gate.  Let's visualize this:

* **Original Gate:**  * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* **Possible New Gates:**  * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Since the gates are arranged in a straight line, we can count the favorable cases by considering the distances:

   log₁₀x + log₁₀y + log₁₀z = 81 
   ```

* Now, let's manipulate the second equation given:

   ```
   (log₁₀x)(log₁₀yz) + (log₁₀y)(log₁₀z) = 468
   (log₁₀x)(log₁₀y + log₁₀z) + (log₁₀y)(log₁₀z) = 468
   ```

**2.  Apply a clever substitution:**

* Let  
   ```
   a = log₁₀x
   b = log₁₀y
   c = log₁₀z
   ```

*  Our system of equations becomes:
   
   ```
   a + b + c = 81 
   a(b + c) + bc = 468
   ```

**3. Solve for the desired quantity:**

* Notice that we want to find  
   
   ```
   √(a² + b² + c²)
   ```

* Expand the square of the first equation:

   ```
   (a + b + c)² = 81²
   a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 6561 
   ```

*  Rearrange the terms:

   ```
   a² + b² + c² = 6561 - 2ab - 2ac - 2bc
   ```

*  We know  `ab + ac + bc = 468` from the second equation. Substitute:

   ```
   a² + b² + c² = 6561 - 2(468) = 5625 
   ```

* Finally, take the square root:

   ```
   √(a² + b² + c²) = √5625 = **75** 
   ```

**Therefore, √(log₁₀x)² + (log₁₀y)² + (log₁₀z)² = 75.** 


sending request to Gemini: Now, summarize the answer below in one sentence, without any intermediate steps or explanations: 
 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Use the given information to simplify the second equation:**

*  Since $xyz = 10^{81}$, we can take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:
   
   ```
   log₁₀(xyz) = log₁₀(10⁸¹)
   log₁₀x + log₁₀y + log₁₀z = 81 
   ```

* Now, let's manipulate the second equation given:

   ```
   (log₁₀x)(log₁₀yz) + (log₁₀y)(log₁₀z) = 468
   (log₁₀x)(log₁₀y + log₁₀z) + (log₁₀y)(log₁₀z) = 468
   ```

**2.  Apply a clever substitution:**

* Let  
   ```
   a = log₁₀x
   b = log₁₀y
   c = log₁₀z
   ```

*  Our system of equations becomes:
   
   ```
   a + b + c = 81 
   a(b + c) + bc = 468
   ```

**3. Solve for the desired quantity:**

* Notice that we want to find  
   
   ```
   √(a² + b² + c²)
   ```

* Expand the square of the first equation:

   ```
   (a + b + c)² = 81²
   a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 6561 
   ```

*  Rearrange the terms:

   ```
   a² + b² + c² = 6561 - 2ab - 2ac - 2bc
   ```

*  We know  `ab + ac + bc = 468` from the second equation. Substitute:

   ```
   a² + b² + c² = 6561 - 2(468) = 5625 
   ```

* Finally, take the square root:

   ```
   √(a² + b² + c²) = √5625 = **75** 
   ```

**Therefore, √(log₁₀x)² + (log₁₀y)² + (log₁₀z)² = 75.** 
 

Gemini response:

 Given that xyz = 10⁸¹ and (log₁₀x)(log₁₀yz) + (log₁₀y)(log₁₀z) = 468, the value of √(log₁₀x)² + (log₁₀y)² + (log₁₀z)² is 75.
