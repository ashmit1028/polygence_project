question:"The teams $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_4$ are in the playoffs. In the semifinal matches, $T_1$ plays $T_4$, and $T_2$ plays $T_3$. The winners of those two matches will play each other in the final match to determine the champion. When $T_i$ plays $T_j$, the probability that $T_i$ wins is $\frac{i}{i+j}$, and the outcomes of all the matches are independent. The probability that $T_4$ will be the champion is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$."

question:"Kathy has $5$ red cards and $5$ green cards. She shuffles the $10$ cards and lays out $5$ of the cards in a row in a random order. She will be happy if and only if all the red cards laid out are adjacent and all the green cards laid out are adjacent. For example, card orders RRGGG, GGGGR, or RRRRR will make Kathy happy, but RRRGR will not. The probability that Kathy will be happy is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$."
