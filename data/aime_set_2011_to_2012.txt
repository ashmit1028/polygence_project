question:"Jar $A$ contains four liters of a solution that is $45\%$ acid. Jar $B$ contains five liters of a solution that is $48\%$ acid. Jar $C$ contains one liter of a solution that is $k\%$ acid. From jar $C$, $\frac{m}{n}$ liters of the solution is added to jar $A$, and the remainder of the solution in jar $C$ is added to jar B. At the end both jar $A$ and jar $B$ contain solutions that are $50\%$ acid. Given that $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $k + m + n$."

question:"In rectangle $ABCD$, $AB = 12$ and $BC = 10$. Points $E$ and $F$ lie inside rectangle $ABCD$ so that $BE = 9$, $DF = 8$, $\overline{BE} \parallel \overline{DF}$, $\overline{EF} \parallel \overline{AB}$, and line $BE$ intersects segment $\overline{AD}$. The length $EF$ can be expressed in the form $m \sqrt{n} - p$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n + p$."

question:"Let $L$ be the line with slope $\frac{5}{12}$ that contains the point $A=(24,-1)$, and let $M$ be the line perpendicular to line $L$ that contains the point $B=(5,6)$. The original coordinate axes are erased, and line $L$ is made the $x$-axis and line $M$ the $y$-axis. In the new coordinate system, point $A$ is on the positive $x$-axis, and point $B$ is on the positive $y$-axis. The point $P$ with coordinates $(-14,27)$ in the original system has coordinates $(\alpha,\beta)$ in the new coordinate system. Find $\alpha+\beta$."

question:"The vertices of a regular nonagon (9-sided polygon) are to be labeled with the digits 1 through 9 in such a way that the sum of the numbers on every three consecutive vertices is a multiple of 3. Two acceptable arrangements are considered to be indistinguishable if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the nonagon in the plane. Find the number of distinguishable acceptable arrangements."

question:"Butch and Sundance need to get out of Dodge. To travel as quickly as possible, each alternates walking and riding their only horse, Sparky, as follows. Butch begins by walking while Sundance rides. When Sundance reaches the first of the hitching posts that are conveniently located at one-mile intervals along their route, he ties Sparky to the post and begins walking. When Butch reaches Sparky, he rides until he passes Sundance, then leaves Sparky at the next hitching post and resumes walking, and they continue in this manner. Sparky, Butch, and Sundance walk at $6,$ $4,$ and $2.5$ miles per hour, respectively. The first time Butch and Sundance meet at a milepost, they are $n$ miles from Dodge, and they have been traveling for $t$ minutes. Find $n + t$."

question:"Ana, Bob, and Cao bike at constant rates of $8.6$ meters per second, $6.2$ meters per second, and $5$ meters per second, respectively. They all begin biking at the same time from the northeast corner of a rectangular field whose longer side runs due west. Ana starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading west, Bob starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading south, and Cao bikes in a straight line across the field to a point $D$ on the south edge of the field. Cao arrives at point $D$ at the same time that Ana and Bob arrive at $D$ for the first time. The ratio of the field's length to the field's width to the distance from point $D$ to the southeast corner of the field can be represented as $p : q : r$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive integers with $p$ and $q$ relatively prime. Find $p+q+r$."
