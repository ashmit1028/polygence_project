,4,Geometry,NC,N,,"Found issue AI finds the AT (angle bisector of given triangle) correctly using the angle bisector theorem. This can easily be used to find the area of a triangle using the area formula. Instead, AI tries to map AT to the form a + b* sqrt (c) which is an incorrect shortcut.  ",

,8,Number Theory,NC,Y,,"Consider a number N with 3 digits (call it abc) in base 7. Consider another number N1 with 3 digits (call it abc) in base 10. N is half N1. Form an equation using this information. Given a is a base 7 integer, find the maximum possible value of abc by solving the equation. Pick the max possible value for a, then b, and then c.  Now correct",
AIME II 2001,1,Number Theory,NC,,,Now correct,
,2,Algebra,C,,,Correct,
,3,Algebra,NC,,,"Found issue Recursion is computed incorrectly. The sequence repeats every 10 terms, not every 8 terms as identified by the model. This leads the answer to be 898, not 256.",

AIME I 2002,1,Probability,C,,,,
,3,Number Theory,NC,Y,,"Found issue We know that Dick is older than Jane (who is 25 years old), so d > 25. The model correctly finds the equation d = 25 + 9(a-b), where a and b are digits, but does not account for the fact that a - b > 0. Instead, it says a - b can range from -9 to 9. This leads to extraneous values of d.  ",
