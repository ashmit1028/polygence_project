question:"The 8 eyelets for the lace of a sneaker all lie on a rectangle, four equally spaced on each of the longer sides. The rectangle has a width of 50 mm and a length of 80 mm. There is one eyelet at each vertex of the rectangle. The lace itself must pass between the vertex eyelets along a width side of the rectangle and then crisscross between successive eyelets until it reaches the two eyelets at the other width side of the rectangle as shown. After passing through these final eyelets, each of the ends of the lace must extend at least 200 mm farther to allow a knot to be tied. Find the minimum length of the lace in millimeters."

question:"Jon and Steve ride their bicycles along a path that parallels two side-by-side train tracks running the east/west direction. Jon rides east at $20$ miles per hour, and Steve rides west at $20$ miles per hour. Two trains of equal length, traveling in opposite directions at constant but different speeds each pass the two riders. Each train takes exactly $1$ minute to go past Jon. The westbound train takes $10$ times as long as the eastbound train to go past Steve. The length of each train is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ miles, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$."

question:"Arnold is studying the prevalence of three health risk factors, denoted by A, B, and C, within a population of men. For each of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man in the population has only this risk factor (and none of the others) is 0.1. For any two of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man has exactly these two risk factors (but not the third) is 0.14. The probability that a randomly selected man has all three risk factors, given that he has A and B is $\frac{1}{3}$. The probability that a man has none of the three risk factors given that he does not have risk factor A is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$."

question:"A rectangle has sides of length $a$ and 36. A hinge is installed at each vertex of the rectangle, and at the midpoint of each side of length 36. The sides of length $a$ can be pressed toward each other keeping those two sides parallel so the rectangle becomes a convex hexagon as shown. When the figure is a hexagon with the sides of length $a$ parallel and separated by a distance of 24, the hexagon has the same area as the original rectangle. Find $a^2$."
