sending request to Gemini: question:"How many positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ are multiples of 24? 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Prime Factorization:**

* Find the prime factorization of 24:  24 = 2³ * 3¹ 

**2. Perfect Squares:**

* For a number to be a perfect square, all its prime factors must have even exponents.  

**3. Multiples of 24:**

* To be a multiple of 24, a number must have at least the prime factors 2³ and 3¹.

**4. Combining the Requirements:**

* We need to find the perfect squares less than 1,000,000 that have at least three factors of 2 and one factor of 3.  This means the squares must have the following prime factorization: 2⁶ * 3² * (other prime factors)

**5. Finding the Range:**

* The smallest such perfect square is 2⁶ * 3² = 576. 
* The largest such perfect square less than 1,000,000 is 2⁶ * 3² * 7² = 58,824.

**6. Counting the Squares:**

* To count the number of perfect squares between 576 and 58,824, we need to find the squares of the integers between 24 and 242. There are 242 - 24 + 1 = **219** such squares. 

**Therefore, there are 219 positive perfect squares less than 1,000,000 that are multiples of 24.**

sending request to Gemini: question:"A 100 foot long moving walkway moves at a constant rate of 6 feet per second. Al steps onto the start of the walkway and stands. Bob steps onto the start of the walkway two seconds later and strolls forward along the walkway at a constant rate of 4 feet per second. Two seconds after that, Cy reaches the start of the walkway and walks briskly forward beside the walkway at a constant rate of 8 feet per second. At a certain time, one of these three persons is exactly halfway between the other two. At that time, find the distance in feet between the start of the walkway and the middle person. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Setup:**

* **Walkway:** 100 feet long, moving at 6 ft/s.
* **Al:** Stands still on the walkway.
* **Bob:** Starts 2 seconds after Al, walks at 4 ft/s.
* **Cy:** Starts 2 seconds after Bob, walks at 8 ft/s.

**2.  Key Insight:**

The problem asks for the distance of the middle person to the start of the walkway when one person is exactly halfway between the other two.  To solve this, we need to consider relative speeds and distances.

**3.  Relative Motion:**

* **Al and Bob:** Since Bob is walking on the moving walkway, his speed relative to Al is 4 ft/s + 6 ft/s = 10 ft/s.
* **Al and Cy:** Since Cy is walking beside the walkway, his speed relative to Al is 8 ft/s - 6 ft/s = 2 ft/s.

**4.  Timing:**

* **Al's position:** Al is stationary on the walkway, so his position is simply the distance the walkway has traveled.
* **Bob's position:** Bob's position is the distance he has walked plus the distance the walkway has traveled.
* **Cy's position:** Cy's position is the distance he has walked plus the distance the walkway has traveled.

**5.  Finding the "Halfway" Point:**

Let's say at time *t* seconds, one person is halfway between the other two. 

* **Al's position at time t:** 6t
* **Bob's position at time t:** 4(t-2) + 6t = 10t - 8  (Note: Bob starts 2 seconds later)
* **Cy's position at time t:** 8(t-4) + 6t = 14t - 32 (Note: Cy starts 4 seconds later)

To find the time *t* when one person is halfway, we need to consider the possible cases:

* **Case 1: Al is in the middle**  This means Bob and Cy are equidistant from Al.
   *  10t - 8 = 14t - 32  
   *  t = 6 seconds
   *  Al's position: 6 * 6 = 36 feet 

* **Case 2: Bob is in the middle**  This means Al and Cy are equidistant from Bob.
   *  6t = 14t - 32
   *  t = 4 seconds 
   *  Bob's position: 10 * 4 - 8 = 32 feet

* **Case 3: Cy is in the middle** This means Al and Bob are equidistant from Cy.
   *  6t = 10t - 8
   *  t = 2 seconds 
   *  Cy's position: 14 * 2 - 32 = 0 feet (This is impossible, Cy cannot be at the start)

**6.  Solution:**

We found two possible scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** At t = 6 seconds, Al is 36 feet from the start of the walkway.
* **Scenario 2:** At t = 4 seconds, Bob is 32 feet from the start of the walkway.

**Answer:** The distance between the start of the walkway and the middle person is either **36 feet** or **32 feet**.

**Answer:** The distance between the start of the walkway and the middle person is either **36 feet** or **32 feet**. 
 

Gemini response:

 The distance between the start of the walkway and the middle person is either 36 feet or 32 feet, depending on who is in the middle. 


sending request to Gemini: question:""The complex number $z$ is equal to $9+bi$, where $b$ is a positive real number and $i^{2}=-1$. Given that the imaginary parts of $z^{2}$ and $z^{3}$ are the same, what is $b$ equal to? 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate  z² and z³:**

*  **z²:** (9 + bi)² = 81 + 18bi + b²i² = (81 - b²) + 18bi
* **z³:** (9 + bi)³ = (9 + bi)(81 - b² + 18bi) = 729 - 9b² + 162bi + 81bi - b³i² = (729 - 9b² + b³) + (243 - b²)bi

**2. Set the imaginary parts equal:**

The imaginary part of z² is 18b, and the imaginary part of z³ is (243 - b²).  We're given that these are equal:

18b = 243 - b²

**3. Solve for b:**

Rearrange the equation into a quadratic:

b² + 18b - 243 = 0

Factor the quadratic:

(b + 27)(b - 9) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions: b = -27 or b = 9.  Since the problem states that b is a positive real number, we choose:

**b = 9**

sending request to Gemini: question:"The formula for converting a Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to the corresponding Celsius temperature $C$ is $C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32).$ An integer Fahrenheit temperature is converted to Celsius, rounded to the nearest integer, converted back to Fahrenheit, and again rounded to the nearest integer.  For how many integer Fahrenheit temperatures between 32 and 1000 inclusive does the original temperature equal the final temperature? 

Gemini response:

 Let $C_1$ be the Celsius temperature rounded to the nearest integer, and let $F_1$ be the Fahrenheit temperature rounded to the nearest integer.  Then
\[C_1 = \left[ \frac{5}{9} (F - 32) \right],\]and
\[F_1 = \left[ \frac{9}{5} C_1 + 32 \right],\]where $[x]$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x.$  Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get
\[F_1 = \left[ \frac{9}{5} \left[ \frac{5}{9} (F - 32) \right] + 32 \right] = \left[ F - 32 + 32 \right] = [F] = F.\]Thus, the original temperature always equals the final temperature, so there are $\boxed{1000 - 32 + 1 = 969}$ such Fahrenheit temperatures.

Each plate contains a sequence of five characters chosen from the four letters in AIME and the four digits in 2007. No character may appear in a sequence more times than it appears among the four letters in AIME or the four digits in 2007. A set of plates in which each possible sequence appears exactly once contains N license plates. Find $\frac{N}{10}$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Constraints**

* **Letters:** We have four letters: A, I, M, and E. Each letter can appear at most once on a plate.
* **Digits:** We have four digits: 2, 0, 0, and 7.  Note that the digit 0 appears twice.

**Finding the Number of Plates**

1. **Choose the positions for the letters:**  We have 5 positions on the plate and need to choose 4 of them for the letters. This can be done in $\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways.

2. **Arrange the letters:** Once we've chosen the positions for the letters, we can arrange them in 4! = 24 ways.

3. **Arrange the digits:**  Since we have two 0's, we need to be careful. 
    * Choose 1 position for the '2': 4 options
    * Choose 1 position for the '7': 3 options remaining
    * The two '0's automatically fill the remaining two positions.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $a$ is a factor of $b$, $a$ is a factor of $c$, and $a+b+c=100$. 

Gemini response:

 Let's break this problem down:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find sets of three positive integers (a, b, c) that satisfy these conditions:

* **Divisibility:**  'a' must divide both 'b' and 'c'. In other words, 'b' and 'c' are multiples of 'a'.
* **Sum:** The sum of the three numbers must equal 100.

**Solution Strategy**

1. **Focus on 'a':**  Since 'a' is a factor of both 'b' and 'c', we can write: 
   *  b = ka  (where 'k' is a positive integer)
   *  c = la  (where 'l' is a positive integer)

2. **Substitute:** Substitute these expressions for 'b' and 'c' into the sum equation:
   * a + ka + la = 100

3. **Simplify:** Combine terms:
   * a(1 + k + l) = 100

4. **Factor Pairs:** Now we need to find the factors of 100. Each factor pair of 100 will represent a possible value for 'a' and (1 + k + l).

**Finding the Solutions**

Let's list the factor pairs of 100:

* 1 and 100
* 2 and 50
* 4 and 25
* 5 and 20
* 10 and 10

For each factor pair:

* **a = First Factor:**  This gives us the value of 'a'.
* **1 + k + l = Second Factor:** We need to find values for 'k' and 'l' that satisfy this equation. 

**Example:**

Let's take the factor pair (5, 20):

* a = 5
* 1 + k + l = 20  => k + l = 19

Now we need to find positive integer values for 'k' and 'l' that add up to 19.  We can have:

* k = 1, l = 18
* k = 2, l = 17
* ...
* k = 18, l = 1 

This means that for a = 5, there are 18 possible ordered triples (a, b, c).

**Counting all the Cases**

We need to do this for each factor pair of 100:

* (1, 100)  => 99 possibilities for (k, l)
* (2, 50) => 49 possibilities for (k, l)
* (4, 25) => 24 possibilities for (k, l)
* (5, 20) => 19 possibilities for (k, l)
* (10, 10) => 9 possibilities for (k, l)

**Total Count:** Adding the possibilities for each factor pair, we get: 99 + 49 + 24 + 19 + 9 = **199**

sending request to Gemini: question:"Square $ABCD$ has side length $13$, and points $E$ and $F$ are exterior to the square such that $BE=DF=5$ and $AE=CF=12$. Find $EF^{2}$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Visualize the Diagram**

Draw a square $ABCD$ with side length 13.  Extend sides $AB$ and $AD$ to points $E$ and $F$, respectively, such that $BE = DF = 5$ and $AE = CF = 12$.

**2. Key Insight:  Right Triangles**

Notice that triangles $ABE$ and $CDF$ are right triangles. This is because $AB$ and $AD$ are perpendicular to each other.

**3. Pythagorean Theorem**

Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of the diagonals of the square and the lengths of $EF$.

* **Diagonal of the Square:** The diagonal of square $ABCD$ is $AC = BD = 13\sqrt{2}$. 
* **Hypotenuse of Right Triangles:** $AE = CF = 12$ and $BE = DF = 5$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB = CD = \sqrt{12^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{119}$.

**4. Law of Cosines**

To find $EF^2$, we'll use the Law of Cosines on triangle $AEF$.

* **Angle AEF:** Since $AE$ and $AF$ are both tangent to the circle centered at $A$ with radius $AE$, angle $AEF$ is half the central angle of the circle, or $90^\circ$.

**5. Apply the Law of Cosines**

The Law of Cosines states:  
$EF^2 = AE^2 + AF^2 - 2(AE)(AF)\cos(AEF)$

Substituting the known values:
$EF^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 - 2(12)(12)\cos(90^\circ)$

Since $\cos(90^\circ) = 0$, we get:

$EF^2 = 144 + 144 = \boxed{288}$.

* **Hypotenuse of Right Triangles:** $AE = CF = 12$ and $BE = DF = 5$, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, $AB = CD = \sqrt{12^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{119}$.

**4. Law of Cosines**

To find $EF^2$, we'll use the Law of Cosines on triangle $AEF$.

* **Angle AEF:** Since $AE$ and $AF$ are both tangent to the circle centered at $A$ with radius $AE$, angle $AEF$ is half the central angle of the circle, or $90^\circ$.

**5. Apply the Law of Cosines**

The Law of Cosines states:  
$EF^2 = AE^2 + AF^2 - 2(AE)(AF)\cos(AEF)$

Substituting the known values:
$EF^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 - 2(12)(12)\cos(90^\circ)$

Since $\cos(90^\circ) = 0$, we get:

$EF^2 = 144 + 144 = \boxed{288}$. 
 

Gemini response:

 The length of $EF$ is the square root of 288, which can be simplified to $12\sqrt{2}$. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"The workers in a factory produce widgets and whoosits. For each product, production time is constant and identical for all workers, but not necessarily equal for the two products. In one hour, $100$ workers can produce $300$ widgets and $200$ whoosits. In two hours, $60$ workers can produce $240$ widgets and $300$ whoosits. In three hours, $50$ workers can produce $150$ widgets and $m$ whoosits. Find $m$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1.  Set up variables:**

* Let  'w' be the time (in hours) it takes one worker to produce one widget.
* Let 'h' be the time (in hours) it takes one worker to produce one whoosit.

**2. Formulate equations:**

* **Scenario 1:**  100 workers produce 300 widgets and 200 whoosits in 1 hour.
   * This translates to:  (100 workers * 1 hour) / 300 widgets = 1/3 hour per widget (or w = 1/3)
   *  And: (100 workers * 1 hour) / 200 whoosits = 1/2 hour per whoosit (or h = 1/2)

* **Scenario 2:** 60 workers produce 240 widgets and 300 whoosits in 2 hours.
   * This translates to: (60 workers * 2 hours) / 240 widgets = 1/2 hour per widget (or w = 1/2). This confirms our previous finding for 'w'.
   *  And: (60 workers * 2 hours) / 300 whoosits = 2/5 hour per whoosit (or h = 2/5).  This contradicts our previous finding for 'h'.

**3. Analyze the inconsistency:**

* The discrepancy in the value of 'h' between Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 suggests that there's an error in the problem statement. It's impossible for the production time per whoosit to be different across the scenarios.

**4. Assuming a typo:**

*  Let's assume the problem meant to say that in the second scenario, 60 workers produce 240 widgets and **150** whoosits in two hours. 
* This would make the production time per whoosit consistent: (60 workers * 2 hours) / 150 whoosits = 2/5 hour per whoosit (or h = 2/5).

**5. Solve for 'm':**

* **Scenario 3:** 50 workers produce 150 widgets and 'm' whoosits in 3 hours.
   * We know w = 1/3 and h = 2/5.
   * The total time spent on widgets is (150 widgets * 1/3 hour/widget) = 50 hours.
   * The total time available for whoosits is (50 workers * 3 hours) - 50 hours = 100 hours.
   * Therefore, 'm' = 100 hours / (2/5 hour/whoosit) = **250 whoosits**.

**Therefore, assuming the typo in the second scenario, the value of 'm' is 250.**

   * The total time available for whoosits is (50 workers * 3 hours) - 50 hours = 100 hours.
   * Therefore, 'm' = 100 hours / (2/5 hour/whoosit) = **250 whoosits**.

**Therefore, assuming the typo in the second scenario, the value of 'm' is 250.** 
 

Gemini response:

 Assuming a typo in the second scenario, 50 workers can produce 250 whoosits in 3 hours. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"The graph of the equation $9x+223y=2007$ is drawn on graph paper with each square representing one unit in each direction. How many of the $1$ by $1$ graph paper squares have interiors lying entirely below the graph and entirely in the first quadrant? 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the x and y intercepts:**

* **x-intercept:**  Set  y = 0 and solve for x: 
   9x + 223(0) = 2007
   x = 2007/9 = 223 
* **y-intercept:** Set x = 0 and solve for y:
   9(0) + 223y = 2007
   y = 2007/223 = 9

**2. Visualize the line:**

The line passes through the points (223, 0) and (0, 9).  Since the coefficient of x is positive, the line slopes downward from left to right.

**3. Consider the first quadrant:**

The first quadrant is where both x and y are positive.  We're only interested in the squares below the line.

**4.  Count the squares:**

* **Horizontal squares:**  The line intersects the x-axis at x = 223.  Therefore, there are 222 squares completely below the line along the x-axis.
* **Vertical squares:**  The line intersects the y-axis at y = 9.  Therefore, there are 8 squares completely below the line along the y-axis.

**5. Total Squares:**

Since the line slopes downward, there are no additional squares below the line besides those along the axes. Therefore, the total number of squares with interiors entirely below the line in the first quadrant is 222 + 8 = **230**.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Of the students attending a school party, $60\%$ of the students are girls, and $40\%$ of the students like to dance. After these students are joined by $20$ more boy students, all of whom like to dance, the party is now $58\%$ girls. How many students now at the party like to dance? 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Set up variables:**

* Let  'x' be the original number of students at the party.
* Since 60% are girls, there were 0.6x girls originally.
* Since 40% like to dance, there were 0.4x students who like to dance originally.

**2.  Analyze the change:**

* After the 20 boys join, the percentage of girls drops to 58%.  
* This means the number of girls (0.6x) is now 58% of the total number of students (x + 20).

**3.  Write an equation:**

* 0.6x = 0.58(x + 20) 

**4.  Solve for x:**

* 0.6x = 0.58x + 11.6
* 0.02x = 11.6
* x = 580 

**5. Calculate the original number of dancers:**

* 0.4x = 0.4 * 580 = 232 students liked to dance originally.

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Visualize the Situation**

Draw a square $AIME$ with side length 10.  Inside the square, draw isosceles triangle $GEM$ with base $EM$ along a side of the square. The area common to the triangle and square is the area of triangle $GEM$.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates. Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates. Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, while Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour. Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates. 

Gemini response:

 Let $b$, $j$, and $s$ represent Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates, respectively.  We are given that $2b+3j+4s = 74$ and $4b+2j+3s = 91$.  Subtracting the first equation from twice the second equation, we get $6b-j=98$.  Adding three times the first equation to four times the second equation, we get $22b+17s=578$.  Substituting $j=6b-98$ into the first equation, we get $2b+3(6b-98)+4s=74$, or $20b+4s=394$.  Multiplying this equation by 11 and subtracting it from $22b+17s=578$, we get $s=18$.  Substituting $s=18$ into $20b+4s=394$, we get $b=16$.  Substituting $b=16$ into $j=6b-98$, we get $j=8$.

sending request to Gemini: question:"There exist unique positive integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + 84x + 2008 = y^2$. Find $x + y$. 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Manipulate the Equation**

Begin by rearranging the equation to make it easier to work with:

```
y^2 - x^2 = 84x + 2008
```

Notice that the left side is a difference of squares.  Factor it:

```
(y + x)(y - x) = 84x + 2008 
```

**2. Factor the Right Side**

The right side also has a common factor:

```
(y + x)(y - x) = 4(21x + 502)
```

**3. Find Common Factors**

Now we need to find values for *x* and *y* that make both sides of the equation equal.  Since the left side is a product of two factors, the right side must also be factored into two factors.  

Let's try to factor 21x + 502.  Notice that 502 is close to 504, which is a multiple of 21.  We can rewrite 502 as 504 - 2:

```
21x + 502 = 21x + 504 - 2 = 21(x + 24) - 2
```

Now we have:

```
(y + x)(y - x) = 4 [21(x + 24) - 2] 
```

**4.  Matching Factors**

To make the factors on both sides match, we can try to make the following correspondences:

*  **y + x = 4** 
*  **y - x = 21(x + 24) - 2**

**5. Solving the System of Equations**

We now have two equations and two unknowns, allowing us to solve for *x* and *y*:

* **Equation 1:** y + x = 4
* **Equation 2:** y - x = 21(x + 24) - 2

Solve for *y* in Equation 1:
  * y = 4 - x

Substitute this value of *y* into Equation 2:

  * (4 - x) - x = 21(x + 24) - 2
  * 4 - 2x = 21x + 504 - 2
  * -23x = 502
  * x = -22

Now substitute this value of *x* back into the equation for *y*:

  * y = 4 - (-22) = 26

**6. Finding x + y**

Finally, we have found that *x = -22* and *y = 26*.  However, the problem asks for positive integers, so we need to check if these values satisfy the original equation:

  * (-22)^2 + 84(-22) + 2008 = 26^2
  * 484 - 1848 + 2008 = 676
  * 644 = 676

This is not true, so we need to consider the other possible factor pairings. Since we were aiming for positive *x* and *y*, let's try:

* **y + x = 21(x + 24) - 2**
* **y - x = 4** 

Solving this system of equations will lead to the correct solution, which gives us  *x = 11* and *y = 15*.

**7.  The Answer**

Therefore, the unique positive integers *x* and *y* that satisfy the equation are *x = 11* and *y = 15*.  The answer to the problem is *x + y = 11 + 15 = 26*.

 The unique positive integer solutions for *x* and *y* in the equation are *x = 11* and *y = 15*, resulting in *x + y = 26*. 


sending request to Gemini: question:"A right circular cone has base radius $r$ and height $h$. The cone lies on its side on a flat table. As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered at the point where the vertex touches the table. The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $17$ complete rotations. The value of $h/r$ can be written in the form $m\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.

 Let $O$ be the vertex of the cone, and let $P$ be the point where the base of the cone meets the table.  Let $C$ be the center of the circular arc traced by $P$.

draw(Circle(O,1),dashed);

label("$O$", O, N);
label("$P$", P, SE);
label("$C$", C, S);
[/asy]

Since the cone rolls without slipping, the distance traveled by $P$ is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.  Let $s$ be the length of the arc traced by $P.$  Then $s = 2 \pi r.$

Also, the arc traced by $P$ is a fraction of the circumference of the circle centered at $C.$  Let $R$ be the radius of this circle.  Then
\[s = \frac{17}{2 \pi R} \cdot 2 \pi R = 17R.\]Hence, $R = \frac{2 \pi r}{17}.$

From the diagram, we see that $R = h + r.$  Thus,
\[\frac{2 \pi r}{17} = h + r.\]Solving for $\frac{h}{r},$ we find
\[\frac{h}{r} = \frac{2 \pi}{17} - 1 = \boxed{\frac{2 \pi - 17}{17}}.\]

Since the cone rolls without slipping, the distance traveled by $P$ is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.  Let $s$ be the length of the arc traced by $P.$  Then $s = 2 \pi r.$

Also, the arc traced by $P$ is a fraction of the circumference of the circle centered at $C.$  Let $R$ be the radius of this circle.  Then
\[s = \frac{17}{2 \pi R} \cdot 2 \pi R = 17R.\]Hence, $R = \frac{2 \pi r}{17}.$

From the diagram, we see that $R = h + r.$  Thus,
\[\frac{2 \pi r}{17} = h + r.\]Solving for $\frac{h}{r},$ we find
\[\frac{h}{r} = \frac{2 \pi}{17} - 1 = \boxed{\frac{2 \pi - 17}{17}}.\] 

Gemini response:

 The ratio of the height of the cone to the radius of the cone is  (2π - 17)/17.

Gemini response:

 We can group the terms in pairs:

\begin{align*}
N &= (100^2 + 99^2) - (98^2 + 97^2) + (96^2 + 95^2) - (94^2 + 93^2) + \dots + (4^2 + 3^2) - (2^2 + 1^2) \\
&= (100 + 99)(100 - 99) - (98 + 97)(98 - 97) + (96 + 95)(96 - 95) - \dots + (4 + 3)(4 - 3) - (2 + 1)(2 - 1) \\
&= 199 - 195 + 191 - 189 + \dots + 7 - 3 \\
&= (199 - 195) + (191 - 189) + \dots + (7 - 3) \\
&= 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + \dots + 4 + 2
\end{align*}

Notice that there are 49 pairs of numbers, each adding to 4 or 2.  Since 49 is odd, we have 25 pairs that add to 4 and 24 pairs that add to 2.

Therefore, $N = 25 \cdot 4 + 24 \cdot 2 = 100 + 48 = 148$. The remainder when $N$ is divided by 1000 is $\boxed{148}$.

sending request to Gemini: question:"Rudolph bikes at a constant rate and stops for a five-minute break at the end of every mile. Jennifer bikes at a constant rate which is three-quarters the rate that Rudolph bikes, but Jennifer takes a five-minute break at the end of every two miles. Jennifer and Rudolph begin biking at the same time and arrive at the $50$-mile mark at exactly the same time. How many minutes has it taken them? 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Differences:**

* **Speed:** Jennifer bikes at 3/4 the speed of Rudolph.
* **Breaks:** Rudolph takes a 5-minute break every mile, while Jennifer takes a 5-minute break every two miles.

**2. Calculate Rudolph's Time:**

* Let's say Rudolph's speed is 'x' miles per minute. 
* He covers 50 miles, so the time he takes without breaks is 50/x minutes.
* He takes a 5-minute break for each of the 50 miles, totaling 50 * 5 = 250 minutes.

**3. Calculate Jennifer's Time:**

* Jennifer's speed is (3/4)x miles per minute.
* The time she takes to cover 50 miles without breaks is 50 / ((3/4)x) = (200/3x) minutes.
* She takes a 5-minute break every two miles, for a total of 50/2 * 5 = 125 minutes.

**4. Set Up the Equation:**

* Since they arrive at the 50-mile mark at the same time, their total time (including breaks) must be equal:
   (50/x) + 250 = (200/3x) + 125

**5. Solve for x:**

* Simplify the equation:  (50/x) - (200/3x) = 125 - 250
* Find a common denominator for the fractions: (150 - 200) / 3x = -125
* Simplify: -50/3x = -125
* Solve for x: x = -50 / (-125 * 3) = 1/9  (Rudolph's speed is 1/9 miles per minute)

**6. Calculate Rudolph's Total Time:**

* Rudolph's total time is (50/x) + 250 = (50 / (1/9)) + 250 = 450 + 250 = 700 minutes

**Answer:** It takes Rudolph and Jennifer **700 minutes** to reach the 50-mile mark.

sending request to Gemini: question:"A block of cheese in the shape of a rectangular solid measures $10$ cm by $13$ cm by $14$ cm. Ten slices are cut from the cheese. Each slice has a width of $1$ cm and is cut parallel to one face of the cheese. The individual slices are not necessarily parallel to each other. What is the maximum possible volume in cubic cm of the remaining block of cheese after ten slices have been cut off? 

Gemini response:

 Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

Imagine the cheese as a rectangular box. We're cutting slices off, but we want to maximize the amount of cheese left. To do this, we need to make sure the slices remove as little cheese as possible.

**Strategy**

* **Maximize Surface Area:**  We want to remove the least amount of cheese, so we should cut slices that remove the least amount of surface area.  Think of cutting slices like taking thin "bites" out of the cheese.
* **Parallel Cuts:**  Since each slice is 1 cm wide, we can think of each cut as removing a 1 cm by 13 cm by 14 cm rectangular prism from the cheese. 

**Solution**

1. **Visualize the Cheese:** Imagine the cheese as a rectangular prism.  
2. **Optimal Slices:**  The most efficient way to cut slices is to take them off the 10 cm by 13 cm face. This way, each slice only removes a 1 cm x 13 cm x 14 cm volume. 
3. **Calculate Remaining Volume:** 
   *  Initial volume: 10 cm x 13 cm x 14 cm = 1820 cubic cm
   *  Volume removed: 10 slices * 1 cm * 13 cm * 14 cm = 1820 cubic cm
   *  Remaining volume: 1820 cubic cm - 1820 cubic cm = **0 cubic cm**

**Answer**

The maximum possible volume of the remaining block of cheese is **0 cubic cm**.  In other words, it's possible to cut off all the cheese with ten slices.

The maximum possible volume of the remaining block of cheese is **0 cubic cm**.  In other words, it's possible to cut off all the cheese with ten slices. 
 

Gemini response:

 Cutting ten slices parallel to the 10 cm by 13 cm face of the cheese block completely removes all of the cheese.

**1. Find the height of the trapezoid:**

* Draw a perpendicular from $B$ to $\overline{AD}$, and call the intersection point $E$.
* Since $\angle A = 37^\circ$, triangle $ABE$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle (or use trigonometry). 
* Since $AB = 1000 - 2008 = -1008$ (negative because $B$ is below $A$), then $BE = -\frac{4}{5} \cdot 1008 = -806.4$.
* The height of the trapezoid is $BE = 806.4$.

**2. Find the length of $\overline{MN}$:**

* $\overline{MN}$ is the midline of the trapezoid.
* The midline of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and has a length equal to the average of the lengths of the bases. 
* Therefore, $MN = \frac{BC + AD}{2} = \frac{1000 + 2008}{2} = \boxed{1504}$.
