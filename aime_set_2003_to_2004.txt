question:"One hundred concentric circles with radii $1, 2, 3, \dots, 100$ are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius $1$ is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius $100$ can be expressed as $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n.$"

question:"A cylindrical log has diameter $12$ inches. A wedge is cut from the log by making two planar cuts that go entirely through the log. The first is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and the plane of the second cut forms a $45^\circ$ angle with the plane of the first cut. The intersection of these two planes has exactly one point in common with the log. The number of cubic inches in the wedge can be expressed as $n\pi$, where n is a positive integer. Find $n$."

question:"Alpha and Beta both took part in a two-day problem-solving competition. At the end of the second day, each had attempted questions worth a total of 500 points. Alpha scored 160 points out of 300 points attempted on the first day, and scored 140 points out of 200 points attempted on the second day. Beta who did not attempt 300 points on the first day, had a positive integer score on each of the two days, and Beta's daily success rate (points scored divided by points attempted) on each day was less than Alpha's on that day. Alpha's two-day success ratio was 300/500 = 3/5. The largest possible two-day success ratio that Beta could achieve is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?"

question:"In order to complete a large job, $1000$ workers were hired, just enough to complete the job on schedule. All the workers stayed on the job while the first quarter of the work was done, so the first quarter of the work was completed on schedule. Then $100$ workers were laid off, so the second quarter of the work was completed behind schedule. Then an additional $100$ workers were laid off, so the third quarter of the work was completed still further behind schedule. Given that all workers work at the same rate, what is the minimum number of additional workers, beyond the $800$ workers still on the job at the end of the third quarter, that must be hired after three-quarters of the work has been completed so that the entire project can be completed on schedule or before?"

question:"Three clever monkeys divide a pile of bananas. The first monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps three-fourths of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The second monkey takes some bananas from the pile, keeps one-fourth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. The third monkey takes the remaining bananas from the pile, keeps one-twelfth of them, and divides the rest equally between the other two. Given that each monkey receives a whole number of bananas whenever the bananas are divided, and the numbers of bananas the first, second, and third monkeys have at the end of the process are in the ratio $3: 2: 1,$what is the least possible total for the number of bananas?"
